MyToken Smart Contract
MyToken is an Ethereum-based smart contract that represents a basic token with features for transferring, burning (destroying), and minting (creating) tokens. It enables users to manage a token ecosystem with distinct ownership and control.

Features
Token Details: The contract stores the token's name, symbol, and total supply upon deployment.
Balances Tracking: Users can check their token balances through address mapping.
Token Transfer: Transferring tokens between accounts is supported.
Token Burning: Token holders can destroy a specified amount of tokens, reducing the total supply.
Token Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.
Getting Started
Deploy: Use a Solidity-compatible environment (e.g., Remix) to deploy the MyToken contract.
Initialization: Set tokenName, tokenSymbol, and _initialSupply during deployment.
Interact: Use functions like transferTokensTo, destroyTokens, and createTokens for interaction.
Example Deployment
Remix: Open Remix at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Compile: Choose Solidity compiler version (^0.8.0) and paste the contract code.
Deploy: Select the network, provide constructor parameters, and deploy.
Usage: Interact with deployed contract using provided functions.
Notes
Security: Prioritize security measures, access control, and input validation for production use.
Ownership: Contract ownership is determined during deployment and managed via onlyOwner modifier.
